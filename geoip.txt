    do we need a fd?
    
    1/ use an installed program? what about security
        SECURITY? since mtr runs as root, the other program will be run as root as well.
                    this is not good.

*   2/ retrieve and parse a webservice in json/xml/*csv*?
        probably better. Though it means we depend on a webservice from there on.
        SECURITY? it has to be dealt with
        HOW?
            Open an HTTP socket?
            Manage it?
            Read the content?
            This is going to be mad...
            But can probably find examples.
            ALL THAT IN ROOT? SERIOUSLY? WELL, THEY DO IT FOR DNS. YES BUT THEY ARE EXPERIENCED SYSPROGRAMERS.
            well we can try to learn.
    
    3/ since we are root, we can try to run a process in nobody.
        could be curl, running in nobody, saving to eg
            /tmp/mtr34822 with rwxrwx--- root nobody
                152.53.56.143 "Shanghai, China"
       But you want to fork? No just make a system call.    

    4/ we may also link against a library. Either a geoip of freegeoip lib (so the
        code would need to include one such lib, perhaps with a database..)
        or a library to retrieve http.
        A GOOD COMPROMISE SEEMS /usr/include/curl/easy.h ......!
